# Crack Detection
## Introduction
In the realm of structural engineering and maintenance, the detection of cracks in materials such as concrete and metal is crucial for ensuring safety and longevity. Traditional methods for crack detection, often reliant on manual inspection and heuristic-based image analysis, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. With the advent of deep learning and computer vision, there is a promising shift towards automated and more accurate methods for crack detection.

This project leverages PyTorch, a widely-used deep learning framework, and ResNet, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture known for its ability to learn deep representations of data, to develop an automated crack detection system. By training a ResNet model on a dataset of images containing cracks and non-cracks, the system aims to identify and localize cracks in new images with high precision.

## Objectives
The core objectives of this project are:
- Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess a dataset of images with annotated cracks. This involves augmenting the data to improve model robustness and ensuring high-quality labels for training.

- Model Architecture: Implement and fine-tune a ResNet model using PyTorch. ResNet's residual connections help in training deep networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, making it well-suited for this task.

- Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the prepared dataset, evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy. Find misclassified samples. Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization will be conducted to enhance detection performance.
